    :param consumer_secret: OAuth consumer secret for app.
    :param access_token: OAuth access token for user the app is acting on
      behalf of.
    :param access_secret: OAuth access token secret for user.

    :keyword count: Number of tweets from the past to get before switching to
      live stream.

    :keyword raw: If True, return each tweet's raw data direct from the socket,
      without UTF8 decoding or parsing, rather than a parsed object. The
      default is False.

    :keyword timeout: If non-None, set a timeout in seconds on the receiving
      socket. Certain types of network problems (e.g., disconnecting a VPN)
      can cause the connection to hang, leading to indefinite blocking that
      requires kill -9 to resolve. Setting a timeout leads to an orderly
      shutdown in these cases. The default is None (i.e., no timeout).

    :keyword url: Endpoint URL for the object. Note: you should not
      need to edit this. It's present to make testing easier.

    .. attribute:: connected

        True if the object is currently connected to the stream.

    .. attribute:: url

        The URL to which the object is connected

    .. attribute:: starttime

        The timestamp, in seconds since the epoch, the object connected to the
        streaming api.

    .. attribute:: count

        The number of tweets that have been returned by the object.

    .. attribute:: rate

        The rate at which tweets have been returned from the object as a
        float. see also :attr: `rate_period`.

    .. attribute:: rate_period

        The ammount of time to sample tweets to calculate tweet rate. By
        default 10 seconds. Changes to this attribute will not be reflected
        until the next time the rate is calculated. The rate of tweets vary
        with time of day etc. so it's usefull to set this to something
        sensible.

    .. attribute:: user_agent

        User agent string that will be included in the request. NOTE: This can
        not be changed after the connection has been made. This property must
        thus be set before accessing the iterator. The default is set in
        :attr: `USER_AGENT`.
